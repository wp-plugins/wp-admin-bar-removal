[Goodbye Admin Bar, Hello Toolbar](http://digwp.com/2012/01/goodbye-admin-bar-hello-toolbar/) Posted on: January 13, 2012 by Jeff Starr

When the Admin Bar hit the streets in WordPress 3.1, people seemed to either love it or hate it. And rightly so, it was a significant change in the appearance of the WP Admin area, and if not disabled in your User Profile, the front-end of your site as well. Many tips, tricks and plugins for customizing the Admin Bar began appearing around the Web. And then just as the dust began to settle, BAM — the “Admin Bar” transforms into the “Toolbar” with the WordPress 3.3 update.

The WordPress 3.3 update focused heavily on streamlining and optimizing the Admin experience. The Admin Bar of WP 3.1 was intended as the “first step toward a front-end editor”. The original Admin Bar was debated for several good reasons:

    It’s enabled on the front-end by default
    Gobbles up too much vertical screen space
    It’s redundant, all links available elsewhere
    It’s not visually appealing in general

Using the many Admin Bar tricks that became available around the Web, WordPress users dealt with the thing in their own way and moved on with their lives. Some use plugins, some custom snippets & scripts, some just love it as-is. But now with the new 3.3 update, the big question is “what works and what doesn’t?” We’re glad you asked..
Admin Bar is dead, long live the Toolbar

If you’ve updated to WP 3.3, you’ve seen the smaller “Toolbar” tucked neat above the Admin area. The new Admin Bar Toolbar seems to address some of the main concerns about the old Admin Bar:

    No longer enabled on front-end by default
    Uses less vertical screen space
    Integrates the Admin header area, so no longer redundant
    It looks a little better (in my opinion)

For those who have not yet updated or have no idea what’s going on, here is a visual comparison of the old “Admin Bar” and the new “Toolbar”:

The new Toolbar certainly looks better, but concerns remain. From what I’ve gathered, the main gripe is that the Toolbar is mandatory, and possibly still redundant, depending on site setup and configuration (plugins, networks, etc.). Is it really mandatory? That sounds silly to me, but seems to be the case:

So yeah, something changed, so the question for the Admin Toolbar is “what works and what doesn’t?” Let’s dig in and see what’s up..
Admin Bar changes, now WP Toolbar

As [Ipstenu puts it](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/hiding-admin-bar-in-wordpress-33#post-2495448): “You don’t have to like it, but it’s here to stay.” So it’s time to look at things practically and get on with it. First of all, if you have a plugin or functions script that hides, removes, or customizes the Admin Bar, definitely investigate to see if everything is still working according to plan.
What works..

After some testing, we’ve seen the following functions.php snippets continue to work in WordPress version 3.3:

// disable the admin bar (front end only) -> show_admin_bar( false );
// disable the admin bar (front end only) -> add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' );

In WP 3.1, these functions hid the Admin Bar on both sides of the fence — front end & back end. In WP 3.3+, these snippets will hide the Admin Toolbar only on the front-end of your site (the public side). Likewise, this snippet of CSS added to your theme’s style.css file hides the Toolbar on the front-end:

/* hide the admin bar (front end only) */ -> #wpadminbar{display:none}

Keep in mind that, when using the CSS method, the Toolbar markup is still present in the source code, but will not be displayed in the browser.

Here is another useful snippet for disabling the Toolbar for lesser users:

// show admin bar only for admins -> if ( !current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) { add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' ); }
// show admin bar only for admins and editors -> if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_posts' ) ) { add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false'); }

Note that this also only applies to Toolbar display on the front-end.
What doesn’t work..

Basically the show_admin_bar() function seems to work as it did before version 3.3, except that now the Toolbar is integral to the Admin area, so disabling it using the previous functions works only on the front-end of your site. So tricks like this stopped working:

If you’re running WP 3.1+ or 3.2+ (not 3.3+), then show_admin_bar() will continue to disable the Admin Bar on both front and back ends of WordPress.

To be continued..

Without a doubt things will continue to change, and it’ll be fun watching as WordPress continues to evolve, Toolbar and all :)

= Add-On =
[Toolbar Node Removal](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-toolbar-node-removal/), is the first add-on of [Toolbar Removal](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-toolbar-removal/), to make easly Node/Group removal, for specific Third Party Plugins Node Group, on future, without modify master code. To Removal of all "Text Links Alone" on DashBoard Backend and User Frontend, for any Plugin that put it on "Admin ToolBar", is simple  necessary, download install and activate only ToolBar Node Removal, and not ToolBar Removal, without loosing cache improvements on complex, and busy, WordPress installations. You can put ToolBar Node Removal, via ftp, to directory /mu-plugins/ and you activate automatically without any action, or needed refresh! Is also possible put ToolBar Removal, to directory /mu-plugins/ since first setup, and removal it is active, by default, before and after first installation of WordPress.
== Screenshots ==
= Plugin Screenshots =
1. The 'old' WP Admin Bar: bigger, clunkier, and redundant ...
2. The 'new' WP ToolBar: smaller, simpler, and bamboozled! No option to disable for back-end!
3. The 'old' WP Admin Bar User Profile Settings: full control ...
4. The 'new' WP ToolBar User Profile Settings: bamboozled! No option to disable for back-end!
